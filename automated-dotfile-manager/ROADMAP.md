# Automated Dotfile Manager: Project Roadmap

## Introduction

Welcome to the project roadmap for the Automated Dotfile Manager. This document outlines the planned features, architectural decisions, and future enhancements for this project. The goal is to create a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly tool for managing dotfiles across multiple systems.

This roadmap is a living document. It will evolve as the project progresses and as we receive feedback from the community.

## Project Vision

The vision for the Automated Dotfile Manager is to simplify the lives of developers, system administrators, and power users by providing a comprehensive solution for dotfile management. We aim to go beyond simple version control by offering features like templating, dependency management, and secure secret handling. The ultimate goal is a "set it and forget it" system that keeps your environment consistent and personalized everywhere.

## Roadmap Structure

This roadmap is organized into several key areas:

- **Core Features:** The essential functionalities that form the foundation of the application.
- **Advanced Features:** Sophisticated capabilities that provide enhanced flexibility and power.
- **Future Enhancements:** Long-term ideas for expanding the project's scope and utility.
- **Technical Architecture:** The underlying design and technical specifications for the project.
